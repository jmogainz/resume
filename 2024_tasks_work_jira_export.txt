 Description 	 
Pyvista allows us to create a scroll bar within the figure and tie a callback function to its movement. 

Create a scroll bar.
Create update_meshes(time), a function that will read through the stored data within the view, select the specific timeframe, and update each mesh accordingly. Mayneed to re-familiarize yourself with the dimensions/shapes of individual data extractions (different extractions have time in different dimensions).

 Description 	 
Decide on 'grammar' or 'instructions', but not both for library and class names. I think 'grammar' is clearer as it ties with boost grammar. 
 

Create "rewardcalculator" library and move 'multicalculators' and 'singlecalculators' out of 'rewards' library.  This should mirror the 'dataextraction' library. Including the "RewardCalculatorFactory", "RewardCalculatorType", "DataRewardContext" in the 'rewardcalculator' library.
Create 'rewardcalculatorinstructionparser' library that mirrors the 'dataextractioninstructionparser' library. 
Create 'rewardcalculatortreebasedparser' library that mirrors the 'dataextractioninstructionparser' library.
Move 'RewardCalculationParser.cpp" from 'grammarbasedrewards' to 'rewardcalculatorinstructionparser' library. 
Move "RewardInfoNodeParser" from the 'rewards' library to 'rewardcalculatortreebasedparser' library and rename to tree-based.
Reduce code in 'rewards" library. Not sure what this means yet.
Rename 'yamlbasedrewards' to 'rewardstreebased'.
Rename 'grammarbasedrewards' to 'rewardsgrammarbased'. 
Rename 'grammarbasedobservations' to 'observationsgrammarbased'. 
Rename 'sensorlaydownactions' to 'actionssensoremplacement'. 
 

Ensure interfaces classes have minimal functionality.

Database file - determine if the database file can be relative. If so, we can move it into the install folder. 
 

Running in Visual Studio with no default set build configuration - This causes issues on Windows when building from RL Simulator as a stand-alone project. It can't be built in release or debug currently unless built from the Python side.

 Description 	 
Afsim research task with what frame times are okay for us to use, and why other frame times are not okay to use because they have a significant spike in total runtime.

It was determined that it was not worth the effort to find the answer to this odd behavior in AFSIM. Attached to this issue are the graphs for both Windows and Linux operating systems that show the frame times that are okay to use and the frame times that are not okay to use for an ai scenario run.

 Description 	 
Determined to be resolved. Windows is the issue. The implementation does not print out an error when it occurs in a separate thread from the main thread. The GNU implementation of the c++ runtime will print out the error message that was thrown in the default std::terminate handler. Windows does not set a default std::terminate handler. So we need to log when you throw an error no matter what. Create custom exception and/or std::terminate callback to make this more robust.

 Description 	 
File Based (works at 5400 with no issues)

csv
json
yaml
flatbuffers (binary or json) 
 

Where does this library get utilized? The environment? The observers?

Do we want an overall summary? (example: how many tracks were detected the overall scenario run, how many assets were lost, how many missiles were fired)

How is the data organized, especially since we hold the current scenario up in batch controller from going to the next scenario?
